/*Below are the topic of c++*/

class - code class.cpp 

inline_function - code  inline_function.cpp

reverse_string - code reverse_string.cpp

this_pointer - code reverse_string.cpp

delete this pointer - should not delete this pointer, once delete this is done, any member of the deleted object should not be accessed after deletion.

/*pointer types */
auto_ptr, unique_ptr, shared_ptr and weak_ptr
Dangling, Void , Null and Wild Pointers
/*pointer types ends */

/*OOPS concepts*/
Object - code class.cpp
Class - code class.cpp
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Abstraction
Encapsulation
/*OOPS concepts ends*/

Access specifiers : public , private , protected
	PROTECTED : Protected access modifier is similar to that of private access modifiers, the difference is that the class member declared as Protected are inaccessible outside the class but they can be accessed by any subclass(derived class) of that class.

In C++ polymorphism is mainly divided into two types:
Compile time Polymorphism
Runtime Polymorphism

instal jenkins on centos

Red Hat / CentOS
You can install Jenkins through yum on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, and other Red Hat based distributions. You need to choose either the Jenkins Long Term Support release or the Jenkins weekly release.

Long Term Support release
A LTS (Long-Term Support) release is chosen every 12 weeks from the stream of regular releases as the stable release for that time period. It can be installed from the redhat-stable yum repository.

sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo \
    https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io.key
sudo yum upgrade
sudo yum install jenkins java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel

Start Jenkins
You can start the Jenkins service with the command:

sudo systemctl start jenkins
You can check the status of the Jenkins service using the command:

sudo systemctl status jenkins

If you have a firewall installed, you must add Jenkins as an exception. You must change YOURPORT in the script below to the port you want to use. Port 8080 is the most common.

YOURPORT=8080
PERM="--permanent"
SERV="$PERM --service=jenkins"

firewall-cmd $PERM --new-service=jenkins
firewall-cmd $SERV --set-short="Jenkins ports"
firewall-cmd $SERV --set-description="Jenkins port exceptions"
firewall-cmd $SERV --add-port=$YOURPORT/tcp
firewall-cmd $PERM --add-service=jenkins
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=http --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload

#to open port from cent os 
su firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=8080/tcp
